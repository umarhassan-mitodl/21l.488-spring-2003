Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

Our endeavor will be to taste test the rich feast of current Irish writing fiction, drama, and poetry. The mode of the course will be discussion; you should come to class each time ready to join in (by asking questions, if nothing else). Soon I will have you sign up for a "lead-off" and a "wrap-up" role. The "lead-off" person is obligated only to point out a crucial issue in that days text and raise the question we will use to begin. The "wrap-up" person will do just that - offer an articulation of the major points raised in the class session.

See the {{% resource_link 12e75393-c6b9-8805-7142-3458fe3b9ece "readings" %}} section for the texts used in this course.

A Preliminary Word About a Hard Subject
---------------------------------------

Plagiarism - use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement - is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarise will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution consult the style guides available in the Writing and Communication Center and the MIT Web site on Plagiarism.
